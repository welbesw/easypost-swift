## Requirements

- iOS 9.0+ / Mac OS X 10.11+
- Xcode 8.0+
- Swift 3.0+

## Installation

EasyPostApi is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install
it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod 'EasyPostApi',  '~> 1.0'
```

## Usage

This library uses the EasyPost JSON api.  Details about interacting with the EasyPost api can be found at [http://www.easypost.com/docs](http://www.easypost.com/docs)

### Set Credentials

Call the set credentials method on a shared instance of the API manager before any susequent calls.  You only need to call this method once a shared instance as it maintains the credentials across calls.

```swift
let apiToken = "YOUR-TOKEN"
EasyPostApi.sharedInstance.setCredentials(apiToken, baseUrl: "https://api.easypost.com/v2/")
```

### Post Address

Save an address record and get back an id

```swift
let address = EasyPostAddress()

address.name = "Johnny Appleseed"
address.company = "Apple"
address.street1 = "1 Infinite Loop"
address.street2 = "Suite 1"
address.city = "Cupertino"
address.state = "CA"

EasyPostApi.sharedInstance.postAddress(address) { (result) -> () in
    dispatch_async(dispatch_get_main_queue(), { () -> Void in
        switch(result) {
        case .Success(let value):
            
            print("Successfully posted address.")
            
        case .Failure(let error):
            print("Error posting address: \((error as NSError).localizedDescription)")
        }
    })
}
```

### Verify Address

After posting an address to the API, use the verify call to verify the address with the address id that has been passed back from the API.

```swift
let addressId = "address-id-from-posting-address"

EasyPostApi.sharedInstance.verifyAddress(addressId, completion: { (verifyResult) -> () in
    dispatch_async(dispatch_get_main_queue(), { () -> Void in
        switch(verifyResult) {
        case .Success(let easyPostAddress):
            print("Successfully verified address.")
        case .Failure(let error):
            print("Error verifying address: \((error as NSError).localizedDescription)")
        
        }
    })
})
```

### Post Shipment

Save a shipment record with a to address, from address, and parcel

```swift
let toAddress = EasyPostAddress()
toAddress.name = "Johnny Appleseed"
toAddress.company = "Apple"
toAddress.street1 = "1 Infinite Loop"
toAddress.street2 = "Suite 1"
toAddress.city = "Cupertino"
toAddress.state = "CA"

let fromAddress = EasyPostAddress()
fromAddress.name = "Johnny Appleseed"
fromAddress.company = "Apple"
fromAddress.street1 = "1 Infinite Loop"
fromAddress.street2 = "Suite 1"
fromAddress.city = "Cupertino"
fromAddress.state = "CA"

let parcel = EasyPostParcel()
parcel.length = NSNumber(float:10.0)	//inches
parcel.width = NSNumber(float:10.0)		//inches
parcel.height = NSNumber(float:10.0)	//inches
parcel.weight = NSNumber(float:10.0)	//ounces

EasyPostApi.sharedInstance.postShipment(toAddress, fromAddress: fromAddress, parcel: parcel) { (result) -> () in
    dispatch_async(dispatch_get_main_queue(), { () -> Void in
        switch(result) {
        case .Success(let shipment):
            
            print("Successfully posted shipment.")
            
            if let id = shipment.id {
                print("Shipment id: \(id)")
            }
            
        case .Failure(let error):
            print("Error posting shipment: \((error as NSError).localizedDescription)")
        }
    })
}
```
### Buy Shipment

Once you've created a shipment record, the rates records are returned inside the shipment object.  You can buy the shipping and get a url to a label with a call to buy the shipment.

```swift
EasyPostApi.sharedInstance.buyShipment("shipment-id", rateId: "rate-id", completion: { (result) -> () in
	//Handle results
	dispatch_async(dispatch_get_main_queue(), { () -> Void in
	    if(result.isSuccess) {
	        print("Successfully bought shipment.")
	        if let buyResponse = result.value {
	            if let postageLabel = buyResponse.postageLabel {
	                if let labelUrl = postageLabel.labelUrl {
	                    print("Label url: \(labelUrl)")
	                }
	            }
	        }
	    } else {
	        print("Error buying shipment: \((result.error as! NSError).localizedDescription)")
	    }
	})
})
```
